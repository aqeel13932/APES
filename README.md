# Artificial Primate Environment Simulator (APES)
APES is a grid world environment with ability for partial observability. It could be used for multi-agent experiments. Its uniqueness is coming from the wide options for vision for every agent.

To read more information about the environment please visit : [Arxiv link coming soon](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.10692)
## Installation
To install the environment we suggest to use conda. In Linux you can see the following steps:
```
git clone https://github.com/aqeel13932/APES.git
conda create -n env_name python=3 matplotlib numpy jupyter scikit-image
source activate env_name
```
If you want to check video recording you can see an example in Example.ipynb but you need to install additional library
```
pip install scikit-video
```
You can check that everything is alright by running the following commands, it'll also print out some information about the performance.
```
cd APES
python Performance.py
```
## Example
If you want to see an example of the environment please check [Example.ipynb](https://github.com/aqeel13932/APES/blob/master/Example.ipynb), it contains a simple and a complex example.
Sample video slowed down and generated by [Example.ipynb](https://github.com/aqeel13932/APES/blob/master/Example.ipynb) is below

TODO
====
1. Parallelize FOV_Calculator for better performance (pull requests are welcome :) ).
2. Improve the documentation.
